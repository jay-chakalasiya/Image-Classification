This project focuses on a practical application of image classifiers built in parent directories...

The code reads images from the 'source' folder and classifies them in the 'Out' folder, it works on pre-trained model, using the google-resnet model traimed on the thousands of classes, you can easily make your own offline search engine, It can propogate through entire device and classifes the images as per your needs, although this project is completed but in next iterations it is also possible to add time and place based searches, even we can add the image description or place based searches, there are models available wchich can analyze the actions from images, that can be addup...

So basically, the focus of the project revolves aroud practical small scale applications of pre-trained classifiers
